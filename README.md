# Udacity-FSWDN-P2
Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. P2: Swiss-system tournament

The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

# Additional features implemented:
* Prevents rematches between players.
* Supports tie (draw) games.
* If the number of players is not even, a "bye" fantom player can be created.
* When two players have the same number of wins, they are ranked according to OMW (Opponent Match Wins), the total number of wins by players they have played against.
* A decorator function was added to get rid of duplications in the code.
